# 📊 FIT3179 Assignment 2 – Interactive Data Storytelling

Live Project: https://yunkai030.github.io/FIT3179-Assignment-2-Interactive-Data-Storytelling/

## 🧠 Overview

This project was developed for the FIT3179 – Data Visualisation subject at Monash University. The goal was to design an engaging, interactive storytelling webpage using real-world data and D3/Vega-Lite charts. My topic focuses on **global deforestation**, aiming to highlight patterns, causes, and country-level trends.

## ✅ What Went Well

- **🌍 Meaningful Topic Choice**  
  Tackles an urgent global issue — deforestation — making the story socially relevant and compelling.

- **📐 Structured Narrative Flow**  
  Each section builds on the last, taking users from a general global view to more specific insights.

- **📊 Interactive Visualizations**  
  Used Vega-Lite and D3.js to create maps, bar charts, and line charts with hover and filter capabilities.

- **🎨 Visual Styling**  
  A coherent color palette and consistent font styling enhance readability and visual engagement.

- **📱 Deployed Online**  
  Fully responsive and accessible via GitHub Pages.

## ❗ What Could Be Improved

This project was built under time and assignment constraints. Here's what could be done better in a future revision:

### 1. 📉 **Data Accuracy and Depth**
- The dataset used for deforestation may lack up-to-date or granular detail for some countries.
- More contextual datasets (e.g., reforestation efforts, policy interventions, economic drivers) could deepen the analysis.

### 2. ⚙️ **Interactivity**
- Some charts are static or offer limited interactivity (e.g., the global map).
- Tooltips and filters could be more dynamic and tailored for user exploration.

### 3. 💬 **Text-Chart Integration**
- In some sections, the explanatory text could more directly reference the visualizations ("as seen in the chart above...").
- More annotations or storytelling cues would help guide the user.

### 4. 🧱 **Code Modularity**
- JavaScript and Vega-Lite code could be refactored into cleaner modules or reusable components.
- A config-driven approach would make future updates easier.

### 5. 📱 **Mobile Optimization**
- While the layout works on mobile, some charts are not fully optimized for smaller screens (e.g., axis labels overlap or become unreadable).
